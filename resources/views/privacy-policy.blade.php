                    This Privacy Policy will provide you information about how we collect, use, and share your personal data. This privacy policy may be updated if we make changes to our privacy policies. We will notify you if there are any significant changes (via email or through DoCommerce admin).

                    We take the time to understand what information is necessary from you to provide our services. Then, we limit the amount of information that we collect. When we don't need the information, we erase it. Our engineers closely work with our security and privacy teams when building or improving products. Our guiding principle in all of our work is that your data belongs to you and that we will only use it to your benefit.<br><br>

                    We will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have permitted us or are legally required to. If we have to share your personal data, we will inform you beforehand unless the law prohibits it.<br><br>

                    DoCommerce's merchant partners and customers do not have access to a privacy team. However, we are committed to helping them comply with their privacy obligations. We make our products and services privacy-friendly to help you.

                    <p class="pt-3">
                    You can access and manage your personal data regardless of where you are located. You may be able to correct, amend or delete your personal data, port it to another provider, limit, or object to certain uses. If you exercise any of these rights, we will not charge more nor provide you with a lower level of service.<br><br>

                    You can exercise your rights to access information regarding your purchase from DoCommerce by contacting the merchant directly. Unfortunately, we can only act as processors and not decide how to handle their data. Our merchants will fulfill these requests by providing them with the tools and answering their questions.<br><br>

                    If you are a merchant, partner, Shop user, DoCommerce employee, or other individuals that DoCommerce has a direct relationship, please submit your data subject request through our online portal. We must verify that you are the person requesting your personal data before we can reply. To do this, we may ask a third party to verify and collect identification documents.<br><br>

                    You can reach us to discuss your concerns if you are unhappy with our response. You can also contact your local privacy or data protection authority at any moment.

                    Although we are a Bangladeshi company, we deal with data from all over the globe. We may transfer your personal data to other states or countries, such as the United States, to run our business. These data could be subject to laws in the country where they are sent. We take precautions to protect your data when we transfer it across borders. We try to send your information only to countries where have strong data protection laws.

                    Our teams are dedicated to protecting your data and ensuring the integrity and security of our platform. Independent auditors also assess the security of data storage and financial information systems. However, we all know that there is no way to ensure that any method of transmitting data over the internet or electronic storage will be secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal data.
